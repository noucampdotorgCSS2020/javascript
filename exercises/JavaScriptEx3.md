> Note:: Complete ALL the exercises in this section.

# Part 1

1.	Examine the code in ``FirstEvent.html`` and then open it in your browser with [http://localhost/JavaScript/FirstEvent.html](http://localhost/JavaScript/FirstEvent.html).  Understand why a mouse click in the hyperlink causes the ``alert()`` message to appear.

1.	Examine the code in ``ButtonEvent.html`` and then open it in your browser with [http://localhost/JavaScript/ButtonEvent.html](http://localhost/JavaScript/ButtonEvent.html).  Understand why a mouse click in the button causes the ``alert()`` message to appear.

1.	Examine the code in ``DropDownEvent.html`` and then open it in your browser with [http://localhost/JavaScript/DropDownEvent.html](http://localhost/JavaScript/DropDownEvent.html).  Understand why a change in the dropdown causes the ``alert()`` message to appear.

1.	Examine the code in ``TextBoxEvent.html`` and then open it in your browser with [http://localhost/JavaScript/TextBoxEvent.html](http://localhost/JavaScript/TextBoxEvent.html).  Understand why a keyup in the text box causes a message to appear in the console log tab.



# Part 2

1.	You are meant to keep your HTML and JavaScript code separate. 

	Examine the code in ``FirstEventV2.html`` and ``FirstEventV2.js``.  Then open it in your browser with [http://localhost/JavaScript/FirstEventV2.html](http://localhost/JavaScript/FirstEventV2.html).  

	This code is typical of how you can do all Event Handling in JavaScript.


1.	Examine the code in ``ButtonEventV2.html`` and ``ButtonEventV2.js``.

	Modify the code in ``ButtonEventV2.js`` so an alert is displayed when the button is clicked.


1.	Examine the code in ``DropDownEventV2.html`` and ``DropDownEventV2.js``.

	Modify the code in ``DropDownEventV2.js`` so an alert displays the type of fruit selected.


1.	Examine the code in ``TextBoxEventV2.html`` and ``TextBoxEventV2.js``.

	Modify the code in ``TextBoxEventV2.html`` and ``TextBoxEventV2.js`` so data about the event appears in the console log tab.
